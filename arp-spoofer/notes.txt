what is arp_spoofing?
 - allows us to redirect the flow of packets
 - instead of flowing right to victim's computer, we can redirect it to flow through hacker computer
 - that means we will get to read the informations for the victim

arp is used so that clients can identify other connected clients and get their mac address
 - clients connect to others with mac addresses
 - run "arp -a" to see all the linked devices

basically works like
 - tell router that my ip is the victims ip
 - tell the victims computer that my ip is the routers ip
 - the victims gonna think that im the router and the router will think that im the victim
 	- i basically act like a mailman
	- puts me as the man in the middle

why is arp spoofing possible?
 - clients accept responses even if they did not send a request
 - clients trust response without any form of """varification"""
 - arp protocol is just shit

you'll need to run the spoofer twice in order to fool both the router and the victim
